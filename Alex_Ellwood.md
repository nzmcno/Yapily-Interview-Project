### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Alex Ellwood at Yapily

This section provides a comprehensive examination of the available information regarding Alex Ellwood’s association with Yapily, drawing from various online sources to construct a detailed profile. The analysis aims to address the user’s request for a detailed search, acknowledging the limitations in accessing certain information and providing a thorough overview of the findings.

#### Background and Role Identification

The initial search for Alex Ellwood in the context of Yapily revealed that he is listed as a Talent Acquisition Partner on his LinkedIn profile, located in the London Area, United Kingdom, with over 500 connections. This role typically involves responsibilities related to recruiting, talent management, and human resources within the organization. Yapily, as described in multiple sources, is a leading open banking infrastructure platform that connects customers to thousands of banks across Europe, enabling access to financial data and payment initiation. The company’s customer base includes disruptive fintechs and industry leaders, and it has raised $69.4 million in funding, employing over 200 people worldwide as of recent reports.

Despite this, detailed information about Alex Ellwood’s specific contributions, achievements, or day-to-day responsibilities at Yapily could not be accessed through the available tools. His LinkedIn profile, while confirming his role, was not fully accessible for deeper insights, and other professional directories like RocketReach mentioned Yapily’s leadership (e.g., COO Precy Kwan) without referencing Alex Ellwood specifically.

#### Educational and Professional Context

One key piece of information is Alex Ellwood’s educational background, which includes attendance at Felixstowe 6th Form, as noted in his LinkedIn profile. This suggests a UK-based education, potentially relevant to his current role in London. However, further details about his academic qualifications, such as degrees or additional training, were not found in the accessible sources. His professional experience is primarily tied to Yapily, with no other companies mentioned in the context of his current role, though a separate search revealed an Alex Ellwood with appointments at dissolved companies (PLANTINE PRODUCTION UK LIMITED and HANGDR SUPPLEMENTS LIMITED), listed as an Accountant and Company Administrator, respectively. Given the different roles and locations (Gibraltar), this is likely a different individual, as it does not align with the Yapily context.

#### Company Overview and Relevance

To provide context, Yapily’s mission and operations were explored through sources like Maddyness UK and Yapily’s own LinkedIn page. Yapily is positioned as an “API Only” technology provider, focusing on enabling innovative financial services through open banking. It solves the problem of access in financial services by securely connecting customers to banks, with a reported annual revenue of $17.2 million in 2025 and a significant presence in Europe. The company’s growth, with over 200 employees and $69.4 million in funding, underscores its importance in the fintech sector, but specific mentions of Alex Ellwood in company news, press releases, or detailed team profiles were absent from the search results.

A news search for “Alex Ellwood Yapily news” yielded results primarily about Yapily’s activities, such as the acquisition of finAPI in May 2022, but no articles specifically mentioned Alex Ellwood. This suggests he may not be a public-facing figure within the company, consistent with a talent acquisition role that is more internally focused.

#### Comparative Analysis and Limitations

The search also uncovered multiple individuals named Alex Ellwood across various fields, such as a canoe sprint athlete, a filmmaker (Alison Ellwood, likely a different person), and authors at The ANU Observer, none of which were associated with Yapily. This highlights the challenge of disambiguating individuals with common names, but the LinkedIn profile and Yapily context provide strong evidence that the Talent Acquisition Partner is the relevant Alex Ellwood for this query.

Limitations in accessing detailed information, particularly from LinkedIn, were evident. Attempts to browse his profile or Yapily’s team pages resulted in no readable content, possibly due to privacy settings, platform restrictions, or technical issues with the search tools. This restricted the ability to provide a more granular view of his professional background, such as years of experience, specific projects, or achievements at Yapily.

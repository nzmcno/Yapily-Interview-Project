> **Prepared for: Alex Ellwood (Talent Acquisition Partner, Yapily)**

---

## 🎯 Question 1: What attracted you to apply for this specific role at Yapily?

**Answer:**

> Yapily’s mission in open banking and the backend focus of this role truly excite me. I want to contribute to building secure infrastructure that supports fairer financial services. The chance to work with Java/Spring Boot in a real fintech setting, especially one leading the open banking space in Europe, is a perfect fit for my career path.

---

## 🚀 Question 2: How do you handle learning new technologies quickly?

**Answer:**

> I start with the official documentation, then move to hands-on experimentation. For instance, when learning Docker for my BankLite project, I created a full environment with containerized PostgreSQL. I also use community forums and maintain a personal learning journal. I focus first on understanding the fundamentals, then build real features, and finally refine based on usage.

---

## ⚡ Question 3: What's your approach to working in a fast-paced startup environment?

**Answer:**

> I enjoy fast-moving environments where I can contribute beyond just code. I stay organized with project tools, communicate frequently, and iterate quickly based on feedback. I’ve worked on prototypes and MVPs, and always document decisions so the team doesn’t lose context.

---

## 🧪 Question 4: How do you ensure code quality while moving fast?

**Answer:**

> I apply TDD from the start. In BankLite, I maintained full test coverage with unit and integration tests. I rely on code reviews, CI pipelines, and documentation to enforce quality. I believe in embedding quality into the development process itself.

---

## 📚 Question 5: Tell me about a time you had to learn something completely new for a project.

**Answer:**

> When building BankLite, I had no prior experience with Docker or PostgreSQL. I split learning into phases: first, basic containerization, then DB integration, and finally orchestration with docker-compose. This systematic approach helped me stay confident while delivering working solutions.

---

## 📈 Question 6: How do you stay updated with industry trends, especially in fintech?

**Answer:**

> I follow Open Banking Expo, Finextra, and FinTech Magazine. I’m active on GitHub and Stack Overflow. I also build projects that reflect current trends—BankLite uses Java 21, Spring Boot 3, and containerization. I’m particularly interested in API security and regulatory compliance.

## 💬 Question 8: How do you handle feedback and continuous improvement?

**Answer:**

> I actively seek feedback and act on it quickly. I take notes during reviews, clarify where needed, and adjust my work. After finishing BankLite, I realized performance could be improved and made enhancements to Docker and DB indexing. I reflect on each project and refine my approach.

---

## 🏢 Question 9: What’s your understanding of Yapily’s talent acquisition needs?

**Answer:**

> With over 200 employees and strong funding, Yapily needs developers who can build reliable, compliant infrastructure.

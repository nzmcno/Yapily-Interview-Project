## 💼 2. **Role & Technical Fit**

**Q: What's your experience with Spring Boot?**

> I've been using Spring Boot for over a year. I’ve built RESTful APIs using Spring MVC, managed data with Spring Data JPA, and implemented security layers using Spring Security with JWT tokens.

**Q: Can you explain RESTful APIs?**

> RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources. They're stateless, scalable, and easy to integrate with modern applications.

**Q: Have you used Docker before?**

> Yes, I’ve used Docker to package Spring Boot applications and run them in isolated containers. I’ve written Dockerfiles and understand how to build multi-stage images for cleaner deployments.

**Q: Have you worked with Kubernetes?**

> I've studied Kubernetes and understand how deployments, services, and pods work. While I haven’t used it in a production environment yet, I’ve tested deploying Dockerized applications on Minikube and Kubernetes playgrounds.

**Q: How do you test your code?**

> I follow TDD principles and write unit tests using JUnit 5. For mocking external APIs, I use WireMock. I’ve also worked with Spring Boot Test for integration testing and used H2 in-memory DB for lightweight test setups.

## 📌 3. **Project-Related (BankLite)**

**Q: Why did you build the BankLite project?**

> I built BankLite as a production-ready banking REST API to demonstrate modern Spring Boot development practices for the Yapily interview. It showcases essential CRUD operations, comprehensive testing, Docker containerization, and professional API documentation - all aligned with open banking infrastructure patterns.

**Q: What was the hardest part of the project?**

> The most challenging aspect was implementing a complete multi-environment setup with both H2 for development and PostgreSQL for production, while ensuring comprehensive test coverage across unit and integration levels. Managing the Docker containerization with proper health checks and database initialization also required careful orchestration.

**Q: How does your project demonstrate production readiness?**

> BankLite includes comprehensive testing (13 tests with 100% pass rate), multi-environment configuration, Docker containerization with health monitoring, Swagger API documentation, proper error handling, and database optimization with indexes and triggers. It follows enterprise-grade practices like transaction management and validation.

**Q: What specific technologies did you use in BankLite?**

> I used Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Data JPA for persistence, PostgreSQL 15 for production database, H2 for testing, Docker & Docker Compose for containerization, Maven for build management, OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation, and JUnit 5 with Mockito for comprehensive testing.

**Q: How is your project structured?**

> The project follows clean architecture with separate layers: REST controllers for API endpoints, service layer for business logic, repository layer for data access, and DTOs for data transfer. It includes proper configuration management, comprehensive documentation, and follows Spring Boot conventions throughout.

**Q: What would you add next to improve the project?**

> I'd add OAuth2/JWT authentication for security, implement audit logging for financial compliance, add pagination and sorting for large datasets, create a circuit breaker pattern for external API calls, and integrate with actual Open Banking APIs. Monitoring with Actuator metrics and distributed tracing would also enhance observability.

## 🧠 4. **Team Problem Solving**

**Q: Tell me about a time you resolved a conflict in a team.**

> In a previous team project, two developers disagreed over code structure. I proposed a joint review session, where we walked through both approaches. We ended up combining the best parts of each and also documented a guideline for future consistency.

**Q: How do you handle code criticism during reviews?**

> I see it as an opportunity to learn. I try to understand the reasoning, ask clarifying questions if needed, and apply suggestions when valid. If I disagree, I respectfully explain my rationale.

**Q: What do you do when you notice something wrong in a teammate’s code?**

> I reach out privately, share what I’ve observed, and suggest a fix. It’s important to maintain a positive tone and treat it as a shared responsibility for quality.

## 👥 5. **Collaboration & Work Style**

**Q: How do you handle remote collaboration?**

> I stay organized using tools like Notion, Jira, and GitHub Projects. I communicate regularly on Slack, document decisions, and make sure nothing is blocked due to lack of communication.

**Q: Have you done pair programming or worked cross-functionally?**

> Yes, I’ve done pair programming for solving tough bugs and onboarding new team members. I’ve also collaborated with product and QA teams to align on requirements and test cases.

**Q: How do you share knowledge in a team?**

> I usually share summaries or lessons learned in a shared doc or chat. I’ve also conducted short demos and code walkthroughs after finishing complex features.
